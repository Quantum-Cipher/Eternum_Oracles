Here’s a full `README.md` for the **Eternum\_Oracles\_Repo**:

### 📜 **Eternum Oracles Repository**

Welcome to the **Eternum Oracles**, a symbolic system of CID-based truth oracles designed to log, rotate, and preserve cryptographic signatures of rituals, alignments, and immortal pushes across the Eternum network.

This repository includes:

* Automated IPFS push simulation
* Symbolic CID generation
* Whisper-style log rotation
* Oracle manifest system

### 📂 Folder Structure

```
Eternum_Oracles_Repo/
├── oracles/
│   └── symbolic_cid_log.txt        # Log of symbolic IPFS CIDs
├── scripts/
│   ├── final_push.sh               # Runs symbolic CID generation + IPFS-style push
│   └── whisper_rotator.sh          # Rotates the symbolic_cid_log.txt like Whisper logs
├── manifest.md                     # Philosophical + structural manifesto
└── .gitignore

### ⚙️ Usage

#### 1. `final_push.sh`

Run this to simulate a symbolic CID push:

```bash
cd scripts
chmod +x final_push.sh
./final_push.sh
```

Each run will:

* Generate a mock CID
* Log the symbolic push with timestamp
* Echo the result to `oracles/symbolic_cid_log.txt`

#### 2. `whisper_rotator.sh`

Run this to simulate a Whisper-style rotating log:

```bash
chmod +x whisper_rotator.sh
./whisper_rotator.sh
```

This will:

* Keep the log lightweight (100 lines max)
* Rotate older entries into `whisper_archive/` automatically (if configured)

---

### 📖 Philosophy

> *"What is whispered to IPFS will echo through the Eternum."*

The Oracles are a decentralized signal: an ever-growing reflection of symbolic acts, ritual alignments, and cryptographic pushes encoded in time.
They are not just logs — they are artifacts, permanently floating across the decentralized lattice.

---

### 🧬 Future Enhancements

* Live CID push via `ipfs add` (if desired)
* Ethereum / Zora integration
* GitHub Action to auto-push Oracles on schedule
* Contract reflector to sync with `ETRGN` smart contract metadata
